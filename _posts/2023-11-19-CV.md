|:--------|--------:|
| **Reinforcement Learning for Proprioceptive Quadrupedal Locomotion** |2022-Now|
|In the actor-critic reinforcement learning architecture  with PPO algorithm, I trained quadrupedal robot without perception ability. Domain Randomization are set to augment the robustness of the learning neural network model and the randomized parameters are predicted by distilling the simulation information into historical proprioceptive data with teacher-student network architecture, which helps in transferring the model to go through sim2real gap. Moreover, curriculum learning methods are used for shaping the sampling process from easy tasks to hard ones. The first curriculum is for classified terrains and the second is for segmented velocity intervals, and each one runs separately. After a brief validation of the model in *Pybullet* environment, the trained model are tested in *Unitree Go1* robot.|

| **Wheel-legged Robot Dynamics and Control System** |2022-2023|
|We designed a combination between wheel robot and legged robot into one robot aiming at both payload carrying tasks with enough speed and diverse terrains traversing tasks. This robot is identical to quadrupedal robot in legged system while it is equipped with one hub motor actuating the wheel in both left and right sides of the body. Concentrating on the legged system, we deployed traditional control architecture which is way more reliable than a learning one. Through model predictive control to calculating the force in stance phase, further with whole-body control, we achieved the stable locomotion of the robot. Though only the traditional Kalman filter are used in the control system, our robot still can cope with uneven terrains and a few slopes or stairs.|

| **Legged Robot with Reconfigurable Jansen Mechanism** |2021-2022|
|To design a legged robot with minus energy consumption and maximum payload capacity, meanwhile remaining the advantage of legged robot to traverse diverse terrains, we modified the *Jansen Mechanism* with extra degree of freedom in translation, which turns the fixed trajectory of a closed loop mechanism into a convertible one.Such DoF is realized by implementing a hydraulic cylinder on one linkage to adjust its length. We built the prototype after elaborate design about both the electrical and the hydraulic system are made.|

| **Wheel-tracked Vehicle Platform** |2022|
|Validation for a wheel-tracked vehicle platform to make sure its design are satisfied with both target demand and safety demand are made in two steps:the first is to calculate the performance metric and designing parameters of the vehicle, and the second is to simulate the whole dynamic system in software including *Amesim, Tracksim, Simulink and Adams*.|
|:--------|--------:|
| **Design of the Braking system for a compact SUV** |2020-2021|
|I Designed the hydraulic braking system of a Compact SUV with known dynamic parameters,from using finite element method to analyse the brake to model an ABS system in *Simulink*.|
